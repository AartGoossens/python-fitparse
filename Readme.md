python-fitparse
===============


*This library is in active development. This are very turbulent right now.*


About
-----

Here's a Python library to parse ANT/Garmin .FIT files. These are files
produced by several newer Garmin cycling computers, notably the Garmin Edge
500 and Edge 800.

The FIT (Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer) file protocol is specified
by ANT (<http://www.thisisant.com/>) and an SDK is available for download at
<http://www.thisisant.com/pages/products/fit-sdk>

I'm currently using version 1.2 of the SDK to develop this library.
